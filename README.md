# Yet Another Password Manager
### Video Demo: <URL>
### Description:
Yet Another Password Manager is just that, a password manager that adds, updates, lists, and deletes passwords.  The passwords are stored as tuples in a dictionary format.  When the manager is closed, the dictionary is written to disk as a JSON file.
The dictionary requires that three data elements be defined:
- Site ID
- username
- password
    Username and password are just that.  Site ID identifies the Website or some identifier that identifies the object requiring username and password.  Site IDs are unique.
